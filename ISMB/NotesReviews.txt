> The authors present the new dynamic programming based procedure IncaRNAtion to tackle the RNA sequence design problem for a given nested RNA secondary structure. IncaRNAtion precomputes the pseudo-partition (sub)functions of all sequences adopting the targeted structure according to an altered Boltzmann weight that incorporates GC-content. Based on probabilities using these weights and the according partition function, IncaRNAtion produces in a weighted randomized traceback sample sequences with the targeted GC-content. The latter requires in addition the identification of the correct GC-tuning factor used in the altered Boltzmann weight. The dynamic programming scheme enables the random sampling of a structure in linear time and space for a given targeted structure.
> Currently, the energy of a (sub)structure is only accessed in terms of stacking base pair contributions. Thus, non-paired nucleotides are not constrained and might form additional base pairs within the minimum free energy structure. To face this problem, the authors use RNAinverse in a seconds step to optimize the un-paired bases of their IncaRNAtion solutions. This hybrid approach shows promising results and is compared to RNAinverse alone. The prediction reliability drops with decreasing GC-content.

The problem of designing RNA sequences with a specific GC-content has strong impact in synthetic biology since most approaches yield too high non-natural GC-content values. Therefore, I can recomment this article for publication while I think the benchmarking (against RNAinverse only) not up to date.

Avec plaisir => Contexte du weighted sampling.

Local would actually be even worse, what we show here is the limited impact of a local postprocessing over the final GC%.

> 3) It could be interesting in the future to merge the glocal strategy with the constrained optimization problem put forth in [3] and the multiple target optimization in [10]. A good sampling approach may replace the use of the genetic algorithms and refute the claim in the discussion following Table 3 of [10] that Frnakenstein has the best nucleotide distribution compared to all other methods.

> The paper by Reinharz et al describes a new approach for inverse RNA folding, based on earlier work of the authors and of the Vienna group. They sample the inverse folding space of a given structure, using a score function based on stacking energies and GC content. This allows to find, rather efficiently, sets of sequences that CAN fold into the desired structure and TEND to have the proper GC content. Candidates undergo filtering for these two criteria afterwards. Since the model does not account for energy contributions of unpaired bases, RNAinverse is called to improve the sequence design in loop regions. Overall, this gives an improvement of over using either method alone, and having control of GC content, of course, is  a desirable feature.

> (1) There are many points where you iterate over "all sequences of length |S|" or all of those which can fold into S; it is not always clear. Why not introduce F(s) for the folding space of a sequence, and F^{-1}(S) for the inverse folding space of a structure, and simply use F^{-1}(S) where this is what you mean?
We prefer controlling the compatibility of a sequence to a given at the energy level, by associating a +infty penalty to disallowed sequences. The set of compatible sequences is therefore implicitly defined as the set of sequences having finite energy.

> (2) You make the computation of Z look like yet another set of DP recurrences, and as a consequence, you need a proof to show that it is linear in $n$. Surely, the reader wonders at that point how you can iterate over (i,j) and compute an (n,n) table in less than quadratic time. This mis-led understanding is created by the Nussinovic style of the recurrences.

That is a great idea! Will do.

Yep. Annotating arrows on this diagram should make things clearer.

Absolutely!

Well, people got used to the M Zuker's Mloops, which include both unpaired and paired positions, thus the apparent redundancy.
