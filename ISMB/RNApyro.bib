  title = {Computational {RNA} secondary structure design: empirical complexity
	and improved methods},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigate the empirical complexity of the RNA secondary
	structure design problem, that is, the scaling of the typical difficulty
	of the design task for various classes of RNA structures as the size
	of the target structure is increased. The purpose of this work is
	to understand better the factors that make RNA structures hard to
	design for existing, high-performance algorithms. Such understanding
	provides the basis for improving the performance of one of the best
	algorithms for this problem, RNA-SSD, and for characterising its
	limitations. RESULTS: To gain insights into the practical complexity
	of the problem, we present a scaling analysis on random and biologically
	motivated structures using an improved version of the RNA-SSD algorithm,
	and also the RNAinverse algorithm from the Vienna package. Since
	primary structure constraints are relevant for designing RNA structures,
	we also investigate the correlation between the number and the location
	of the primary structure constraints when designing structures and
	the performance of the RNA-SSD algorithm. The scaling analysis on
	random and biologically motivated structures supports the hypothesis
	that the running time of both algorithms scales polynomially with
	the size of the structure. We also found that the algorithms are
	in general faster when constraints are placed only on paired bases
	in the structure. Furthermore, we prove that, according to the standard
	thermodynamic model, for some structures that the RNA-SSD algorithm
	was unable to design, there exists no sequence whose minimum free
	energy structure is the target structure. CONCLUSION: Our analysis
	helps to better understand the strengths and limitations of both
	the RNA-SSD and RNAinverse algorithms, and suggests ways in which
	the performance of these algorithms can be further improved.},

  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Backround RNAexinv is an interactive java application that
	performs RNA sequence design, constrained to yield a specific RNA
	shape and physical attributes. It is an extended inverse RNA folding
	program with the rationale behind that the generated sequences should
	not only fold into a desired structure, but they should also exhibit
	favorable attributes such as thermodynamic stability and mutational
	robustness. RNAexinv considers not only the secondary structure in
	order to design sequences, but also the mutational robustness and
	the minimum free energy. The sequences that are generated may not
	fully conform with the given RNA secondary structure, but they will
	strictly conform with the RNA shape of the given secondary structure
	and thereby take into consideration the recommended values of thermodynamic
	stability and mutational robustness that are provided. RESULTS: The
	output consists of designed sequences that are generated by the proposed
	method. Selecting a sequence displays the secondary structure drawings
	of the target and the predicted fold of the sequence, including some
	basic information about the desired and achieved thermodynamic stability
	and mutational robustness. RNAexinv can be used successfully without
	prior experience, simply specifying an initial RNA secondary structure
	in dot-bracket notation and numerical values for the desired neutrality
	and minimum free energy. The package runs under LINUX operating system.
	Secondary structure predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA
	package. CONCLUSIONS: RNAexinv is a user friendly tool that can be
	used for RNA sequence design. It is especially useful in cases where
	a functional stem-loop structure of a natural sequence should be
	strictly kept in the designed sequences but a distant motif in the
	rest of the structure may contain one more or less nucleotide at
	the expense of another, as long as the global shape is preserved.
	This allows the insertion of physical observables as constraints.

	function. Therefore, secondary structure prediction has gained much
	interest. Here, we consider the inverse RNA folding problem, which
	means designing RNA sequences that fold into a given structure. RESULTS:
	We introduce a new algorithm for the inverse folding problem (INFO-RNA)
	that consists of two parts; a dynamic programming method for good
	initial sequences and a following improved stochastic local search
	that uses an effective neighbor selection method. During the initialization,
	we design a sequence that among all sequences adopts the given structure
	with the lowest possible energy. For the selection of neighbors during
	the search, we use a kind of look-ahead of one selection step applying
	an additional energy-based criterion. Afterwards, the pre-ordered
	neighbors are tested using the actual optimization criterion of minimizing
	the structure distance between the target structure and the mfe structure
	of the considered neighbor. We compared our algorithm to RNAinverse
	and RNA-SSD for artificial and biological test sets. Using INFO-RNA,
	we performed better than RNAinverse and in most cases, we gained
	better results than RNA-SSD, the probably best inverse RNA folding

	Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has

	thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing
	reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient
	to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore,
	common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively
	abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation.
	We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags

	structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation,
	classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose
	a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge,
	hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three
	distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the
	Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred

	orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative
	to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types
	with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric
	type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced.
	High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently
	available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl
	or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second
	base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups
	on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the
	standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition
	of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry,
	and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional
	motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions
	are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary

	modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

	that fold into specific secondary structures has many potential biomedical
	and synthetic biology applications. To date, this problem remains
	computationally difficult, and current strategies to address it resort
	to heuristics and stochastic search techniques. The most popular
	methods consist of two steps: First a random seed sequence is generated;
	next, this seed is progressively modified (i.e. mutated) to adopt
	the desired folding properties. Although computationally inexpensive,
	this approach raises several questions such as (i) the influence

	that may be affected by energy barriers in the mutational landscape.
	In this article, we present RNA-ensign, a novel paradigm for RNA
	design. Instead of taking a progressive adaptive walk driven by local
	search criteria, we use an efficient global sampling algorithm to
	examine large regions of the mutational landscape under structural
	and thermodynamical constraints until a solution is found. When considering
	the influence of the seeds and the target secondary structures, our
	results show that, compared to single-path directed searches, our
	approach is more robust, succeeds more often and generates more thermodynamically
	stable sequences. An ensemble approach to RNA design is thus well

	to increase. However, whereas the RNA folding problem from an algorithmic
	viewpoint has an elegant and efficient solution, the inverse RNA
	folding problem appears to be hard. RESULTS: In this paper we present
	a genetic algorithm approach to solve the inverse folding problem.
	The main aims of the development was to address the hitherto mostly
	ignored extension of solving the inverse folding problem, the multi-target
	inverse folding problem, while simultaneously designing a method
	with superior performance when measured on the quality of designed
	sequences. The genetic algorithm has been implemented as a Python
	program called Frnakenstein. It was benchmarked against four existing
	methods and several data sets totalling 769 real and predicted single
	structure targets, and on 292 two structure targets. It performed
	as well as or better at finding sequences which folded in silico
	into the target structure than all existing methods, without the
	heavy bias towards CG base pairs that was observed for all other
	top performing methods. On the two structure targets it also performed
	well, generating a perfect design for about 80% of the targets. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our method illustrates that successful designs for the inverse RNA
	folding problem does not necessarily have to rely on heavy biases
	in base pair and unpaired base distributions. The design problem
	seems to become more difficult on larger structures when the target
	structures are real structures, while no deterioration was observed
	for predicted structures. Design for two structure targets is considerably
	more difficult, but far from impossible, demonstrating the feasibility
	of automated design of artificial riboswitches. The Python implementation
	is available at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/research/genome/software/frnakenstein.},

  abstract = {{The analysis of the relationship between sequences and structures
	(i.e., how mutations affect structures and reciprocally how structures
	influence mutations) is essential to decipher the principles driving
	molecular evolution, to infer the origins of genetic diseases, and
	to develop bioengineering applications such as the design of artificial
	molecules. Because their structures can be predicted from the sequence
	data only, RNA molecules provide a good framework to study this sequence-structure
	relationship. We recently introduced a suite of algorithms called
	RNAmutants which allows a complete exploration of RNA sequence-structure
	maps in polynomial time and space. Formally, RNAmutants takes an
	input sequence (or seed) to compute the Boltzmann-weighted ensembles
	of mutants with exactly k mutations, and sample mutations from these
	ensembles. However, this approach suffers from major limitations.
	Indeed, since the Boltzmann probabilities of the mutations depend
	of the free energy of the structures, RNAmutants has difficulties
	to sample mutant sequences with low G+C-contents. In this article,
	we introduce an unbiased adaptive sampling algorithm that enables
	RNAmutants to sample regions of the mutational landscape poorly covered
	by classical algorithms. We applied these methods to sample mutations
	with low G+C-contents. These adaptive sampling techniques can be
	easily adapted to explore other regions of the sequence and structural
	landscapes which are difficult to sample. Importantly, these algorithms
	come at a minimal computational cost. We demonstrate the insights
	offered by these techniques on studies of complete RNA sequence structures
	maps of sizes up to 40 nucleotides. Our results indicate that the
	G+C-content has a strong influence on the size and shape of the evolutionary
	accessible sequence and structural spaces. In particular, we show
	that low G+C-contents favor the apparition of internal loops and
	thus possibly the synthesis of tertiary structure motifs. On the
	other hand, high G+C-contents significantly reduce the size of the
	evolutionary accessible mutational landscapes.}},

  abstract = {We describe an algorithm for designing the sequence of one or more
	interacting nucleic acid strands intended to adopt a target secondary
	structure at equilibrium. Sequence design is formulated as an optimization
	problem with the goal of reducing the ensemble defect below a user-specified
	stop condition. For a candidate sequence and a given target secondary
	structure, the ensemble defect is the average number of incorrectly
	paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of
	unpseudoknotted secondary structures. To reduce the computational
	cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence,
	candidate mutations are evaluated on the leaf nodes of a tree-decomposition
	of the target structure. During leaf optimization, defect-weighted
	mutation sampling is used to select each candidate mutation position
	with probability proportional to its contribution to the ensemble
	defect of the leaf. As subsequences are merged moving up the tree,
	emergent structural defects resulting from crosstalk between sibling
	sequences are eliminated via reoptimization within the defective
	subtree starting from new random subsequences. Using a Θ(N(3) )
	dynamic program to evaluate the ensemble defect of a target structure
	with N nucleotides, this hierarchical approach implies an asymptotic
	optimality bound on design time: for sufficiently large N, the cost
	of sequence design is bounded below by 4/3 the cost of a single evaluation
	of the ensemble defect for the full sequence. Hence, the design algorithm
	has time complexity Ω(N(3) ). For target structures containing N
	∈{100,200,400,800,1600,3200} nucleotides and duplex stems ranging
	from 1 to 30 base pairs, RNA sequence designs at 37$\,^{\circ}$C
	typically succeed in satisfying a stop condition with ensemble defect
	less than N/100. Empirically, the sequence design algorithm exhibits
	asymptotic optimality and the exponent in the time complexity bound
